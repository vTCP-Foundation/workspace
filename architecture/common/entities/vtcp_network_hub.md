# vTCP Network Hub

- The Hub is responsible for network connectivity, ensuring fast and efficient routing between [vTCP Network](/architecture/common/entities/vtcp_network.md) participants and actively participating in transaction processing. The Hub operates with user-deposited funds (users top up their balance during the hub onboarding process through the [BTC <-> vTCP Custody Protocol](/architecture/btc-federation/protocols/BTC%20<->%20vTCP%20Custody%20Protocol.md)). 

- The Hub operates the vTCP protocol by maintaining one or more active [vTCP nodes](/architecture/common/entities/vtcp_network_node.md)

# Route Discovery Protocol

**Status:** Placeholder - Protocol specification to be developed

## Overview

This protocol defines the mechanism for discovering optimal payment paths through the [vTCP Network](/architecture/common/entities/vtcp_network.md), including multi-hop routing with asset conversions.

## Scope

The route discovery protocol covers:
- Path finding algorithms for multi-hop payments
- Cost optimization across routing fees and conversion rates
- Multi-asset path discovery (finding routes that span different asset types)
- Liquidity availability checks along potential paths
- Privacy-preserving route discovery mechanisms

# Channel Rebalancing Protocol

**Status:** Placeholder - Protocol specification to be developed

## Overview

This protocol defines the cryptographic mechanisms and message flows for bilateral rebalancing of [settlement lines](/architecture/common/entities/vtcp_settlement_line.md) between two [vTCP nodes](/architecture/common/entities/vtcp_network_node.md).

## Scope

The rebalancing protocol covers:
- Cryptographic signature requirements for balance updates
- Message structure for proposing and accepting new balances
- State synchronization between nodes
- Rollback and dispute resolution mechanisms

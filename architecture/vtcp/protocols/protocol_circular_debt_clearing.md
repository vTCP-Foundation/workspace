# Circular Debt Clearing Protocol

**Status:** Placeholder - Protocol specification to be developed

## Overview

This protocol enables optimization of [settlement lines](/architecture/common/entities/vtcp_settlement_line.md) when multiple nodes form circular debt relationships (e.g., A→B→C→A).

## Scope

The circular debt clearing mechanism identifies cycles in the settlement line graph and optimizes balances across all participating settlement lines simultaneously, reducing the net obligations between nodes.

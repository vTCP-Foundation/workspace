## Description
Refactor and enhance topology sending logic in max flow calculation transactions to support additional topology sending for exchange equivalents when exchange rates are available.

## Requirements and DOD

### Core Requirements
1. **Refactor topology sending logic** in `MaxFlowCalculationSourceFstLevelTransaction` and `MaxFlowCalculationSourceSndLevelTransaction`:
   - Extract topology sending logic into separate reusable method
   - Method should accept equivalent parameter for which to send topology
   - Method should send both `ResultMaxFlowCalculationMessage` and `ResultMaxFlowCalculationGatewayMessage`

2. **Enhance source-side topology sending**:
   - After sending standard topology for `mEquivalent`, check for exchange rates from `mEquivalent` to any `exchangeEquiv`
   - For each `exchangeEquiv` where exchange rate exists, call topology sending method to send topology for that equivalent
   - Use separate topology messages for each `exchangeEquiv`

3. **Refactor topology sending logic** in `MaxFlowCalculationTargetFstLevelTransaction` and `MaxFlowCalculationTargetSndLevelTransaction`:
   - Extract topology sending logic into separate reusable method (same pattern as source-side)
   - Method should accept equivalent parameter for which to send topology

4. **Enhance target-side topology sending**:
   - After sending standard topology for `mEquivalent`, check for exchange rates from any `exchangeEquiv` to `mEquivalent`
   - For each `exchangeEquiv` where exchange rate exists, call topology sending method to send topology for that equivalent
   - Use separate topology messages for each `exchangeEquiv`

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Topology sending logic extracted into reusable methods in all four transaction classes
- [ ] Source-side transactions send additional topology for each equivalent with available exchange rates from `mEquivalent`
- [ ] Target-side transactions send additional topology for each equivalent with available exchange rates to `mEquivalent`
- [ ] Enhanced topology sending uses separate messages for each equivalent
- [ ] Existing single-equivalent behavior preserved (backward compatibility)
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and conventions in the codebase

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Analyze Current Topology Sending Implementation
- Examine existing topology sending logic in the four transaction classes
- Identify common patterns and code that can be extracted
- Document current message sending approach

### Step 2: Extract Topology Sending Method
- Create reusable method `sendTopologyForEquivalent(SerializedEquivalent equivalent)` in each transaction class
- Move existing topology sending logic into this method
- Ensure method handles both `ResultMaxFlowCalculationMessage` and `ResultMaxFlowCalculationGatewayMessage`

### Step 3: Implement Enhanced Exchange Rate Logic
- Add logic to check for available exchange rates after standard topology sending
- For source-side: check rates from `mEquivalent` to `exchangeEquiv`
- For target-side: check rates from `exchangeEquiv` to `mEquivalent`
- Call `sendTopologyForEquivalent()` for each equivalent with available rates

### Step 4: Validation and Testing
- Verify enhanced topology sending works correctly
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing single-equivalent operations
- Test with various exchange rate configurations

## Test Plan

### Objective
Verify that enhanced topology sending works correctly for multi-equivalent scenarios while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Test Scope
- Enhanced topology sending logic in all four transaction classes
- Exchange rate availability checking
- Message sending for additional equivalents
- Backward compatibility with single-equivalent operations

### Key Test Scenarios

#### Success Path Testing
1. **Source-side with available exchange rates**:
   - Node has exchange rates from `mEquivalent` to multiple `exchangeEquiv`
   - Verify additional topology messages sent for each equivalent with available rates
   - Verify standard topology still sent for `mEquivalent`

2. **Target-side with available exchange rates**:
   - Node has exchange rates from multiple `exchangeEquiv` to `mEquivalent`
   - Verify additional topology messages sent for each equivalent with available rates
   - Verify standard topology still sent for `mEquivalent`

3. **Backward compatibility**:
   - Empty `exchangeEquivalents` vector (legacy behavior)
   - Verify only standard topology sent for `mEquivalent`
   - No additional topology messages sent

#### Edge Case Testing
4. **No exchange rates available**:
   - `exchangeEquivalents` non-empty but no exchange rates found
   - Verify only standard topology sent
   - No errors or exceptions thrown

5. **Partial exchange rate availability**:
   - Exchange rates available for some but not all `exchangeEquiv`
   - Verify topology sent only for equivalents with available rates

### Success Criteria
- All enhanced topology sending scenarios work correctly
- Backward compatibility preserved for legacy single-equivalent operations
- No regression in existing topology collection functionality
- Enhanced topology messages contain correct equivalent-specific data

## Verification and Validation

### Architecture Integrity

### Performance
- Topology sending performance not significantly degraded
- Additional message sending proportional to available exchange rates
- No unnecessary overhead when no exchange rates available

### Scalability
- Solution scales with number of available exchange equivalents
- No N^2 complexity introduced in topology sending

### Reliability
- Enhanced logic handles missing or expired exchange rates gracefully
- No impact on core topology collection reliability
- Proper error handling for edge cases

### Maintainability
- Extracted methods improve code maintainability
- Enhanced logic clearly documented and understandable
- Consistent with existing codebase patterns

### Cost
- Minimal computational overhead from enhancement
- Network message overhead proportional to available exchange rates

### Compliance
- Implementation follows established coding standards
- No deviation from project architecture principles

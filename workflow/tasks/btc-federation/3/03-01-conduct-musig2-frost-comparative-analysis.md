- [PRD](../../../prd/btc-federation/03_musig2_frost_comparative_analysis.md)

# Description
Conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of MuSig2 and FROST multisignature schemes for Bitcoin Taproot implementations. This analysis will evaluate performance characteristics, security properties, implementation complexity, and scalability considerations for federation sizes ranging from 64 to 512+ participants. The deliverable will be a detailed technical report that provides decision-makers with clear guidance on multisignature scheme selection based entirely on external research, academic literature, and industry implementations.

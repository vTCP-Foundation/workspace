## Description
Implement and test FROST multisig functionality with 64 participants using 32-of-64 threshold configuration. This task validates multisig address creation, transaction execution, and balance verification through actual blockchain transactions using the FROST threshold signature scheme.

## Requirements and DOD

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-0**: Reset blockchain network to genesis block before test execution
- **FR-1**: Create FROST multisig address with 64 participants and 32-of-64 threshold
- **FR-2**: Execute Transaction 1: Miner wallet → Multisig address with 1 confirmation
- **FR-3**: Execute Transaction 2: Multisig address → Miner wallet with 1 confirmation
- **FR-4**: Verify balance changes after each transaction
- **FR-5**: Log transaction hashes and balance changes throughout the process

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-1**: Multisig operations (address creation, key generation, signing, verification) complete within 2 minutes
- **PR-2**: Blockchain transaction times excluded from multisig performance metrics
- **PR-3**: Resource usage tracking for 64-participant operations

### Definition of Done

- [ ] All tests pass in local regtest environment

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Configuration
1. **Environment Setup**
   - Reset blockchain network to genesis block using `make btc-reset`
   - Start fresh Bitcoin regtest node
   - Start miner using `make btc-miner-start`
   - Verify node is running and mining blocks

2. **FROST Implementation**
   - Implement 64-participant key generation with FROST
   - Setup 32-of-64 threshold configuration
   - Create multisig address derivation using FROST

### Phase 2: Multisig Operations
1. **Key Generation**
   - Generate 64 participant keys using FROST protocol
   - Perform distributed key generation (DKG)
   - Create threshold signing setup with 32-of-64 threshold

2. **Address Creation**
   - Derive multisig address from FROST aggregated keys
   - Validate address format and accessibility

### Phase 3: Transaction Execution
1. **Transaction 1: Miner → Multisig**
   - Create transaction from miner wallet to multisig address
   - Broadcast transaction to regtest network
   - Monitor for 1 confirmation
   - Verify balance changes

2. **Transaction 2: Multisig → Miner**
   - Create transaction from multisig to miner wallet
   - Execute 32-of-64 FROST threshold signing
   - Broadcast signed transaction
   - Monitor for 1 confirmation
   - Verify balance changes

### Phase 4: Logging and Metrics
1. **Transaction Logging**
   - Log transaction hashes
   - Log balance changes
   - Track operation timestamps

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Measure FROST multisig operation times (excluding blockchain)
   - Track resource usage
   - Validate 2-minute completion requirement

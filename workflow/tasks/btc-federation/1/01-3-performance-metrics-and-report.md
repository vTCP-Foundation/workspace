## Description
Collect comprehensive performance metrics for both MuSig2 and FROST multisig schemes across all target participant configurations (64, 128, 256, 512 participants with corresponding 50% thresholds) and generate a detailed performance report. This task leverages existing implementations from tasks 01-1 and 01-2, extending them to cover larger participant counts while maintaining full blockchain transaction validation.

## Requirements and DOD

### Functional Requirements

  - 64 participants / 32 threshold (reuse existing implementation)
  - 128 participants / 64 threshold

  - Transaction 1: Miner wallet → Multisig address with 1 confirmation
  - Transaction 2: Multisig address → Miner wallet with 1 confirmation
  - Balance verification after each transaction
  - Transaction hash and balance logging
- **FR-4**: Collect comprehensive performance metrics for each configuration, including:
  - Multisig address creation time (separate measurement)

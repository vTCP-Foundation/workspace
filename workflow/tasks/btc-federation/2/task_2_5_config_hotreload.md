- [ ] Component notification system with dependency ordering
- [ ] Rollback mechanism for failed configuration updates
- [ ] State synchronization without dropping active connections
- [ ] Configuration diff detection and selective updates
- [ ] Component isolation during reload process
- [ ] Signal masking during critical operations
- [ ] Error handling and recovery for reload failures
- [ ] Hot-reload completion within 2 seconds target
- [ ] Unit tests covering all reload scenarios (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for multi-component reload workflows

# Implementation Plan

## Step 1: Signal Management Infrastructure
1. Implement signal handling system:
   - SIGHUP signal registration and handling
   - Signal masking during critical operations (must be implemented as a publicly available core method)
   - Graceful signal processing and queuing
   - Cross-platform signal compatibility
2. Create configuration reload coordinator:
   - Central orchestration of reload process
   - Component dependency resolution
   - Atomic operation management
   - Error tracking and rollback coordination
3. Add signal safety mechanisms:
   - Re-entrant signal handling prevention
   - Critical section protection
   - Resource cleanup on signal interruption
4. Implement reload state machine:
   - States: idle, validating, updating, rolling_back, failed
   - State transitions with proper validation
   - Timeout handling for each phase

## Step 2: Configuration Validation & Staging
1. Implement configuration staging system:
   - Load new configuration in isolation
   - Comprehensive validation without affecting running system
   - Dependency validation (network addresses, file paths)
   - Resource availability checks
2. Create configuration diff analysis:
   - Compare new vs current configuration
   - Identify changed sections and affected components
   - Determine update strategy (restart vs update)
   - Optimization for minimal disruption
3. Add validation pipeline:
   - Syntax validation (YAML structure)
   - Semantic validation (address reachability)
   - Resource validation (file permissions, port availability)
   - Cross-component compatibility checks
4. Implement backup and versioning:
   - Current configuration backup before changes
   - Configuration history tracking
   - Rollback point creation and management

## Step 3: Component Notification & Update System
1. Design component update interface:
   - Standard interface for configuration updates
   - Component readiness and capability reporting
   - Update acknowledgment and status reporting
   - Error reporting with detailed context
2. Implement dependency-ordered updates:
   - Component dependency graph
   - Sequential update with proper ordering
   - Parallel updates where safe
   - Circular dependency detection and handling
3. Create component isolation mechanisms:
   - Pause component operations during update
   - Buffer incoming requests/operations
   - Maintain critical path availability
   - Resource lock management
4. Add component update strategies:
   - In-place updates for compatible changes
   - Graceful restart for incompatible changes
   - State preservation during updates
   - Connection maintenance where possible

## Step 4: Rollback & Error Recovery
1. Implement comprehensive rollback system:
   - Automatic rollback on any component failure
   - State restoration to pre-update condition
   - Component rollback coordination
   - Partial rollback for failed components
2. Create error classification and handling:
   - Validation errors (prevent update start)
   - Component update errors (trigger rollback)
   - System errors (attempt recovery)
   - Critical errors (emergency fallback)
3. Add recovery strategies:
   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
   - Fallback to known-good configuration
   - Emergency mode with minimal configuration
   - Manual intervention escalation
4. Implement monitoring and alerting:
   - Reload operation tracking and metrics
   - Error rate monitoring and alerting
   - Performance impact measurement
   - Success/failure audit logging

## Step 5: Integration & Performance Optimization
1. Integrate with all system components:
   - Network manager configuration updates
   - Peer storage configuration changes
   - Protocol handler updates
   - Logging configuration updates
2. Create comprehensive testing suite:
   - Individual component reload testing
   - Full system reload scenarios
   - Error injection and recovery testing
   - Performance and timing validation
3. Add performance optimization:
   - Minimize component downtime during reload
   - Optimize validation and update operations
   - Reduce memory allocation during reload
   - Background preparation for faster updates
4. Implement operational procedures:
   - Reload monitoring and observability
   - Administrative tools and commands
   - Documentation and troubleshooting guides
   - Production deployment considerations

# Description
Develop comprehensive unit tests for SafetyRules and VotingRule components implemented in Task 05-02, focusing on consensus safety properties, vote validation, and quorum formation.

# Requirements and DOD
- **Coverage Target**: >90% unit test coverage for both components
- **SafetyRules Tests**: Vote validation, locked QC management, safety constraints
- **VotingRule Tests**: Vote collection, quorum checking, QC formation
- **Safety Properties**: Prevention of conflicting votes and double voting
- **Quorum Logic**: Threshold validation and voter bitmap management
- **Edge Cases**: Invalid votes, malformed QCs, boundary conditions
- **Bug Fixes**: Fix any defects discovered during testing

# Implementation Plan

## Step 1: SafetyRules Component Tests
- Vote validation against locked QC
- Safety constraint enforcement
- Locked QC updates and management
- Prepare QC handling
- Proposal validation logic

## Step 2: VotingRule Component Tests
- Vote collection and storage
- Quorum threshold checking (â‰¥2f+1)
- QC formation from valid votes
- Vote deduplication handling
- Invalid vote rejection

## Step 3: Safety Property Tests
- Prevention of conflicting votes
- Double voting detection
- Safety rule violation scenarios
- Locked QC consistency

## Step 4: Quorum Formation Tests
- Threshold boundary conditions
- Voter bitmap accuracy
- Partial quorum handling
- Invalid quorum rejection

## Step 5: Integration Between Components
- SafetyRules and VotingRule interaction
- State consistency between components
- Error propagation handling

## Step 6: Edge Cases and Error Handling
- Malformed vote handling
- Corrupted QC recovery
- Resource limits and exhaustion

# Verification and Validation

## Architecture integrity
- Clean separation between safety and voting logic
- Proper component isolation

## Security
- Safety properties maintained under all conditions
- No vote manipulation vulnerabilities

## Reliability
- Consistent component state
- Robust error handling

# Restrictions
- Achieve minimum 90% test coverage
- Validate all safety properties hold
- Fix all discovered bugs before completion
- All tests must pass consistently

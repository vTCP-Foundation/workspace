- [PRD](/workflow/prd/federation/05_hotstuff_consensus.md)
- [Previous tasks](/workflow/tasks/federation/05/)

# Description
Develop comprehensive Byzantine fault tolerance tests covering 15+ specific Byzantine behaviors, validating the system's ability to maintain consensus with up to 1 Byzantine node in a 5-node network, with automated detection and recovery validation.

# Requirements and DOD
- **BFT Resilience**: System maintains consensus with 1 Byzantine node in 5-node network
- **15+ Byzantine Scenarios**: Comprehensive coverage of Byzantine behaviors
- **Automated Detection**: Verify Byzantine behavior detection mechanisms
- **Recovery Validation**: Ensure system recovers from Byzantine attacks
- **Safety Preservation**: Consensus safety maintained under all scenarios
- **Liveness Testing**: Progress continues despite Byzantine participants
- **Bug Fixes**: Fix any vulnerabilities discovered during testing

# Implementation Plan

## Step 1: Byzantine Leader Scenarios
- **Equivocation**: Leader sends conflicting proposals to different nodes
- **Fork Attempts**: Leader tries to create competing chain branches
- **Invalid Proposals**: Leader sends malformed or invalid blocks
- **Selective Proposal**: Leader sends proposals only to subset of nodes
- **Delayed Proposals**: Leader withholds proposals to cause timeouts

## Step 2: Byzantine Follower Scenarios
- **Double Voting**: Node votes for multiple blocks in same phase
- **Invalid Votes**: Node sends malformed or invalid vote messages
- **Selective Voting**: Node votes only for specific subset of proposals
- **Vote Withholding**: Node refuses to vote on valid proposals
- **Phase Confusion**: Node votes in wrong consensus phase

## Step 3: Network Attack Scenarios
- **Message Replay**: Replaying old consensus messages
- **Message Reordering**: Delivering messages out of order
- **Message Dropping**: Selectively dropping messages to/from nodes
- **Timing Attacks**: Manipulating message delivery timing
- **Flooding Attacks**: Overwhelming nodes with excess messages

## Step 4: View-Change Manipulation
- **False Timeouts**: Triggering unnecessary view changes
- **View Confusion**: Sending messages for wrong view numbers
- **Leader Election Disruption**: Interfering with leader selection
- **Stale Message Injection**: Using messages from previous views

## Step 5: Advanced Byzantine Scenarios
- **Coordinated Attacks**: Multiple Byzantine nodes working together
- **Adaptive Attacks**: Changing attack strategy during consensus
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Attempting to exhaust node resources
- **State Corruption**: Trying to corrupt consensus state

## Step 6: Detection and Recovery Testing
- **Byzantine Detection**: Verify honest nodes detect Byzantine behavior
- **Evidence Collection**: Proper documentation of Byzantine actions
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: System continues operating after detection
- **Isolation Procedures**: Byzantine nodes properly isolated

# Verification and Validation

## Security
- All Byzantine attacks properly detected and handled
- Safety properties maintained under all attack scenarios
- No consensus violations possible with f<n/3 Byzantine nodes

## Performance
- System performance degrades gracefully under attack
- Recovery time from Byzantine scenarios within acceptable limits

## Reliability
- Consensus continues operating with 1 Byzantine node out of 5
- Liveness maintained despite Byzantine interference

# Restrictions
- Test all 15+ Byzantine scenarios comprehensively
- Validate 1 Byzantine node tolerance in 5-node network
- Fix all discovered vulnerabilities before completion
- All tests must demonstrate successful Byzantine fault tolerance

- [PRD](/workflow/prd/btc-federation/05_hotstuff_consensus.md)

# Description
Implement performance baseline measurement and monitoring capabilities for the consensus system, establishing metrics for latency, throughput, resource usage, and logging integration.

# Requirements and DOD
- **Consensus Latency**: Measure block proposal to finality timing
- **Throughput Metrics**: Blocks per second and transaction processing
- **Resource Monitoring**: Memory usage, CPU utilization, network bandwidth
- **Logging Integration**: Structured logging for all critical consensus events
- **Performance Baselines**: Document baseline measurements for future comparison
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Basic metrics collection and reporting
- **Documentation**: Performance characteristics and optimization guidance

# Implementation Plan

## Step 1: Latency Measurement
- Block proposal to commitment timing
- Individual phase duration measurement
- Vote collection and QC formation timing
- View change and leader election latency

## Step 2: Throughput Analysis
- Blocks per second under normal load
- Message processing throughput
- Vote processing capacity
- QC formation rate

## Step 3: Resource Usage Profiling
- Memory allocation and garbage collection
- CPU utilization during consensus
- Network bandwidth consumption
- Storage I/O patterns

## Step 4: Logging System Integration
- Structured logging for all consensus events
- Log levels and categorization
- Performance-sensitive logging optimization
- Log aggregation and analysis

## Step 5: Monitoring Infrastructure
- Metrics collection and storage
- Performance dashboard creation
- Alerting for performance degradation
- Historical trend analysis

## Step 6: Baseline Documentation
- Performance characteristics documentation
- Optimization recommendations
- Scalability analysis
- Resource requirement guidelines

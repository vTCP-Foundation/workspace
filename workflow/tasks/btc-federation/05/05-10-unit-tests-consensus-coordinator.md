# Description
Develop comprehensive unit tests for the HotStuffConsensus coordinator implemented in Task 05-02, focusing on message processing, state coordination, and component integration.

# Requirements and DOD
- **Coverage Target**: >90% unit test coverage for HotStuffConsensus coordinator
- **Message Processing**: Proposal, vote, timeout, and new view message handling
- **State Coordination**: View management, phase transitions, QC updates
- **Component Integration**: Interaction with BlockTree, SafetyRules, VotingRule
- **State Transitions**: Validation of all consensus state changes
- **Error Handling**: Invalid message processing and recovery
- **Bug Fixes**: Fix any defects discovered during testing

# Implementation Plan

## Step 1: Message Processing Tests
- ProcessProposal() method validation
- ProcessVote() method validation
- ProcessTimeout() method validation
- Invalid message handling and rejection

## Step 2: State Management Tests
- View number tracking and updates
- Current phase management
- Locked QC and Prepare QC updates
- State consistency validation

## Step 3: Component Coordination Tests
- BlockTree interaction and updates
- SafetyRules consultation and validation
- VotingRule integration and QC formation
- Component state synchronization

## Step 4: State Transition Tests
- View advancement logic
- Phase transition validation
- QC update triggers
- State rollback scenarios

## Step 5: Concurrency and Thread Safety Tests
- Concurrent message processing
- State update atomicity
- Race condition prevention
- Lock-free operation validation

## Step 6: Error Handling and Recovery Tests
- Invalid message rejection
- Component failure handling
- State corruption recovery
- Error propagation patterns

# Verification and Validation

## Architecture integrity
- Coordinator properly orchestrates all components
- Clean separation of responsibilities

## Security
- State transitions follow consensus protocol exactly
- No unauthorized state modifications

## Performance
- Efficient message processing
- Minimal coordination overhead

## Reliability
- Consistent coordinator state
- Robust error handling and recovery

# Restrictions
- Achieve minimum 90% test coverage
- Validate all state transitions are correct
- Fix all discovered bugs before completion
- All tests must pass consistently

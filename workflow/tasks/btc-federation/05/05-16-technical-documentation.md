- [PRD](/workflow/prd/federation/05_hotstuff_consensus.md)

# Description
Create comprehensive technical documentation for the HotStuff consensus implementation, including architecture overview, API documentation, testing procedures, and troubleshooting guides.

# Requirements and DOD
- **Architecture Overview**: High-level system design and component interaction
- **API Documentation**: Complete interface documentation with examples
- **Testing Procedures**: Guidelines for running and extending test suites
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and debugging procedures
- **Developer Guide**: Getting started and contribution guidelines
- **Integration Guide**: How to integrate consensus engine with real systems
- **ADR Updates**: Update existing ADRs with implementation decisions

# Implementation Plan

## Step 1: Architecture Documentation
- System overview and component responsibilities
- Data flow diagrams and state transitions
- Interface boundaries and contracts
- Design decisions and trade-offs

## Step 2: API Documentation
- Complete interface documentation
- Method signatures and parameters
- Usage examples and code samples
- Error conditions and handling

## Step 3: Testing Documentation
- Test suite organization and structure
- Running unit, integration, and E2E tests
- Adding new test cases and scenarios
- Test data and mock configuration

## Step 4: Troubleshooting Guide
- Common issues and solutions
- Debugging procedures and tools
- Log analysis and interpretation
- Performance troubleshooting

## Step 5: Developer Guide
- Getting started with development
- Code organization and conventions
- Contribution guidelines and workflow
- Building and deployment procedures

## Step 6: Integration Guide
- Replacing mock components with real implementations
- Network layer integration
- Storage layer integration
- Cryptographic integration

## Step 7: ADR Updates
- Update ADR-005 with implementation details
- Create new ADRs for significant implementation decisions
- Document architectural choices made during development

# Verification and Validation

## Architecture integrity
- Documentation accurately reflects implementation
- Clear explanation of design decisions

## Maintainability
- Comprehensive documentation for future developers
- Easy to update and extend documentation

# Restrictions
- Documentation must be complete and accurate
- All APIs must be documented with examples
- Update all relevant ADRs

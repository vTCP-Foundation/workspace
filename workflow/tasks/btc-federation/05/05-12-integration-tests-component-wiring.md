# Description
Develop comprehensive integration tests for component wiring implemented in Task 05-05, focusing on MessageHandler, PhaseManager, ViewManager, LeaderElection, and the overall dependency injection framework.

# Requirements and DOD
- **Coverage Target**: >90% integration test coverage for all component interactions
- **Message Flow Tests**: End-to-end message routing and processing
- **Phase Coordination Tests**: State transitions between consensus phases
- **View Management Tests**: View advancement and leader rotation
- **Dependency Injection Tests**: Component wiring and lifecycle management
- **Error Propagation Tests**: Error handling across component boundaries
- **Bug Fixes**: Fix any defects discovered during testing

# Implementation Plan

## Step 1: MessageHandler Integration Tests
- Message routing to appropriate handlers
- Handler coordination and sequencing
- Message validation and filtering
- Error handling in message processing

## Step 2: PhaseManager Integration Tests
- Phase transition orchestration
- Coordination with consensus components
- State synchronization across phases
- Phase timeout and recovery handling

## Step 3: ViewManager Integration Tests
- View advancement coordination
- Timeout management and triggering
- Leader election integration
- View synchronization across components

## Step 4: LeaderElection Integration Tests
- Leader selection consistency
- Round-robin rotation validation
- Leader validation across components
- Election state management

## Step 5: Dependency Injection Tests
- Component instantiation and wiring
- Lifecycle management (start/stop)
- Interface satisfaction validation
- Configuration propagation

## Step 6: End-to-End Integration Tests
- Complete message flow through all components
- Multi-component state transitions
- Error propagation and recovery
- Resource cleanup and shutdown

# Verification and Validation

## Architecture integrity
- All components properly integrated through interfaces
- Clean dependency boundaries maintained

## Security
- Message validation across component boundaries
- State transition security maintained

## Performance
- Efficient message routing without bottlenecks
- Minimal integration overhead

## Reliability
- Graceful error handling across components
- Consistent state during component interactions

# Restrictions
- Achieve minimum 90% integration test coverage
- Validate all component interactions work correctly
- Fix all discovered bugs before completion
- All tests must pass consistently

# Description
Develop comprehensive unit tests for the BlockTree component implemented in Task 05-02, focusing on block management, fork handling, ancestor relationships, and tree operations.

# Requirements and DOD
- **Coverage Target**: >90% unit test coverage for BlockTree component
- **Block Management**: Addition, retrieval, and storage operations
- **Fork Handling**: Multiple chain branches and conflict resolution
- **Ancestor Operations**: Chain traversal and relationship validation
- **Tree Operations**: Pruning, cleanup, and maintenance functions
- **Edge Cases**: Invalid blocks, circular references, corrupted state
- **Bug Fixes**: Fix any defects discovered during testing

# Implementation Plan

## Step 1: Basic Block Operations Tests
- Block addition and retrieval by hash
- Duplicate block handling
- Invalid block rejection

## Step 2: Parent-Child Relationship Tests
- Parent-to-children mapping accuracy
- Child-to-parent relationship validation
- Orphan block handling

## Step 3: Ancestor Chain Tests
- Ancestor traversal algorithms
- Lowest common ancestor calculation
- Chain depth and height validation

## Step 4: Fork Management Tests
- Multiple competing chains
- Fork detection and resolution
- Longest chain rule application

## Step 5: Tree Maintenance Tests
- Tree pruning operations
- Committed block tracking
- Memory cleanup and optimization

## Step 6: Edge Cases and Error Handling
- Circular reference prevention
- Corrupted tree state recovery
- Resource exhaustion scenarios

# Verification and Validation

## Architecture integrity
- BlockTree maintains consistent internal state
- Proper isolation from other components

## Performance
- Efficient tree operations for large chains
- Memory usage optimization

## Reliability
- Consistent tree state across operations
- Robust error handling

# Restrictions
- Achieve minimum 90% test coverage
- Fix all discovered bugs before completion
- All tests must pass consistently

- [PRD-02: Log Rotation Testing for BTC Federation](../../prd/btc-federation-test-suite/02-log-rotation-testing.md)

# Description
Create a dedicated Go module in `test/logger/` that implements automated testing of log rotation functionality in containerized btc-federation environments. The test validates that log rotation occurs within 10 seconds using a 1kB file size limit and verifies the creation of rotated log files.

# Requirements and DOD

## Core Implementation Requirements
1. **Test Module Structure**:
   - Create Go package in `test/logger/` directory
   - Implement `rotation_test.go` with comprehensive rotation testing
   - Create `go.mod` file for the test module with required dependencies
   - Implement helper functions for container management and file validation
   - Use standard Go testing framework with proper test naming conventions

2. **Container Management**:
   - Create and configure container with custom logging parameters
   - Set `LOGGING_FILE_NAME` and `LOGGING_FILE_MAX_SIZE` environment variables
   - Configure container with `FileMaxSize: "1kB"` for quick rotation testing
   - Implement container lifecycle management (create, start, monitor, cleanup)
   - Handle container networking and volume mounting for log file access

3. **Log Rotation Validation**:
   - Monitor log file creation and growth for 10 seconds
   - Detect when original log file reaches 1kB size limit
   - Verify creation of rotated log file with `.1` suffix
   - Validate that rotation preserves original file content
   - Confirm continued logging to new primary log file after rotation

4. **Test Execution Flow**:
   - **Setup Phase**: Create container with test configuration
   - **Execution Phase**: Start container and monitor for 10 seconds
   - **Validation Phase**: Check for rotated files and validate content
   - **Cleanup Phase**: Stop container and remove test artifacts

# Test Plan

## Objective
Validate that the log rotation test module correctly identifies log rotation functionality in containerized btc-federation environments within specified time constraints.

## Test Scope
- Container creation and configuration accuracy
- Log file monitoring and rotation detection
- File system validation and content integrity
- Test execution timing and timeout handling
- Cleanup and artifact management

## Environment & Setup
- Docker environment with container management capabilities
- File system with sufficient space for log files and containers
- Go development environment with testing framework
- Network access for container image operations

## Mocking Strategy
- Integration testing with real Docker containers (no mocking of Docker operations)
- Real file system operations for log file monitoring
- Use actual btc-federation binary for realistic log generation
- Mock external network dependencies if needed for container isolation

## Key Test Scenarios

### Container Management Testing
1. **Container Creation Test**:
   - Verify container created with correct environment variables
   - Confirm `LOGGING_FILE_NAME` and `LOGGING_FILE_MAX_SIZE` properly set
   - Validate container starts successfully with test configuration
   - Check that btc-federation binary executes within container

2. **Container Lifecycle Test**:
   - Test container start, monitoring, and stop operations
   - Verify proper error handling for container failures

# Description
Implement network resilience testing functionality that validates P2P connections can recover after network disruptions. This task extends the basic P2P connection testing to include network failure simulation and recovery validation.

# Requirements and DOD

## Functional Requirements
1. **Modify ConfigureNetworkConditions method**:
   - Accept specific node parameter instead of applying to all cluster nodes
   - Change parameter from `conditions map[string]interface{}` to `conditions *NetworkConditions`
   - Support network isolation/disconnection conditions

2. **Create NetworkConditions structure**:
   - Define struct matching vtcpd-test-suite pattern
   - Include network isolation capabilities
   - Support enable/disable network functionality

3. **Create TestP2PConnectionResilience test**:
   - Start 2 nodes and verify connections (using existing patterns from TestP2PConnectionSingle)
   - Disable network on one node using ConfigureNetworkConditions
   - Verify connections are broken (without log checks)
   - Re-enable network on the node
   - Wait 5 seconds and verify connections are restored (without log checks)

## Technical Requirements
- Use provided cryptographic keys for node configuration
- Follow existing test patterns and naming conventions
- Maintain compatibility with existing cluster management

## Definition of Done
- [x] NetworkConditions struct implemented
- [x] ConfigureNetworkConditions method modified to accept single node and NetworkConditions
- [x] TestP2PConnectionResilience test implemented and passing
- [x] Network isolation and recovery functionality working
- [x] Test completes within reasonable time (< 120 seconds)
- [x] Code follows existing patterns and conventions

# Implementation Plan

## Step 1: Define NetworkConditions Structure
- Create NetworkConditions struct following vtcpd-test-suite pattern
- Include network isolation/enable fields
- Document structure usage

## Step 2: Modify ConfigureNetworkConditions Method
- Change method signature to accept specific node and NetworkConditions
- Implement network isolation logic using iptables or similar
- Add RemoveNetworkConditions method for single node

## Step 3: Implement TestP2PConnectionResilience
- Copy base structure from TestP2PConnectionSingle
- Add network disruption phase with validation
- Add recovery phase with validation
- Use provided cryptographic keys

## Step 4: Testing and Validation
- Verify test runs consistently
- Validate network isolation works correctly
- Ensure proper cleanup of network conditions

# Test Plan

## Test Objectives
Verify that network resilience testing functionality works correctly and provides reliable results.

## Test Scope
- NetworkConditions structure functionality
- Modified ConfigureNetworkConditions method behavior
- TestP2PConnectionResilience test execution
- Network isolation and recovery mechanics

## Success Criteria
- Test establishes initial connections successfully
- Network isolation breaks connections as expected
- Network recovery restores connections within expected timeframe
- All network conditions are properly cleaned up

## Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: Network disruption and recovery works as designed
2. **Edge Cases**: Proper cleanup when test fails or is interrupted

# Verification and Validation

## Architecture integrity
✅ **Simple Task**: Changes follow existing cluster and testing patterns without architectural modifications.

## Security  
✅ **Simple Task**: No security implications - test infrastructure only.

## Performance
✅ **Simple Task**: Test execution time expected < 120 seconds, acceptable for testing infrastructure.

## Scalability
✅ **Simple Task**: Limited to 2-node testing, no scalability concerns.

## Reliability
✅ **Simple Task**: Uses existing reliable cluster management, adds network condition management.

## Maintainability
✅ **Simple Task**: Follows existing code patterns and conventions.

## Cost
✅ **Simple Task**: No additional infrastructure costs.

## Compliance
✅ **Simple Task**: Follows project policies and coding standards.

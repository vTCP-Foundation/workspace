# Description
Implement comprehensive P2P connection test at `test/p2p/p2p_test.go` that validates end-to-end P2P connectivity between two btc-federation nodes using real libp2p cryptographic key pairs. This test integrates all previous enhancements to provide complete verification of the P2P networking stack with authentic cryptographic components.

# Requirements and DOD
## Requirements

- Include generated key pairs as constants in test file for consistent testing
- Configure each node's private key in its conf.yaml
- Configure each node's public key in the other node's peers.yaml
- Test creates 2 btc-federation nodes with proper peers.yaml configuration
- Verify TCP connections are established (1 or 2 connections acceptable)
- Validate connection success messages in both node logs
- Test completes within 60 seconds
- Test passes consistently (>95% reliability)
- Integration with all enhanced cluster.go and node.go methods
- Proper resource cleanup after test completion

## Definition of Done

- [x] Test successfully creates and configures 2 nodes with peers.yaml

- [x] Test execution time within 60-second limit
- [x] Proper test cleanup and resource management
- [x] Test documentation and comments
- [x] Test passes consistently across multiple runs
- [x] Integration with existing test infrastructure patterns

# Implementation Plan
## Step 1: Test file structure and setup
- Create `test/p2p/` directory if it doesn't exist
- Create `p2p_test.go` with proper package and imports
- Define test constants (timeouts, ports, container names)
- Set up test context and cleanup patterns

## Step 2: Cryptographic key generation and node configuration
- Generate libp2p ECDSA key pairs using btc-federation keygen utility
- Add generated key pairs as constants in test file:
  - Node A private key → Node A's conf.yaml
  - Node A public key → Node B's peers.yaml
  - Node B private key → Node B's conf.yaml
  - Node B public key → Node A's peers.yaml
- Configure first node (Node A) with specific port and peers
- Configure second node (Node B) with specific port and peers
- Set up peers.yaml configuration for both nodes to connect to each other
- Use enhanced NodeConfig with peers support from task 03-3
- Start both nodes using cluster management

## Step 3: Connection establishment verification
- Wait for nodes to start and attempt connections
- Use configurable wait time with maximum timeout
- Implement retry logic for connection detection
- Handle timing variations in connection establishment

## Step 4: TCP connection verification
- Use enhanced `CheckTCPConnections` method from task 03-1
- Verify 1 or 2 TCP connections between nodes (bidirectional support)
- Use `GetActiveConnectionsCount` for connection counting
- Validate connections are on expected ports (9000/9001)

## Step 5: Log verification
- Use enhanced `CheckLogContains` method from task 03-2
- Search for connection success patterns in both node logs:
  - "Connection established with peer"
  - "Successfully established connection"
  - "Successfully connected to peer"
- Verify connection events in both directions

## Step 6: Test cleanup and error handling
- Implement proper cleanup of Docker resources
- Handle test failures gracefully
- Provide detailed error messages for debugging
- Ensure no resource leaks

# Implementation Results

## Files Created
- **`test/p2p/p2p_test.go`**: Complete P2P connection test implementation with real cryptographic keys and three test functions:
  - `TestP2PConnection`: Main end-to-end P2P connectivity test using real libp2p key pairs
  - `TestP2PConnectionReliability`: Multi-iteration reliability test (3 iterations, >95% success rate)
  - `TestP2PConnectionTiming`: Test execution time validation (within 60-second limit)

## Cryptographic Keys Generated
Using btc-federation keygen utility, the following key pairs were generated and included as constants:

**Node A Key Pair:**
- Private Key: `NodeAPrivateKey` - configured in Node A's conf.yaml
- Public Key: `NodeAPublicKey` - configured in Node B's peers.yaml

**Node B Key Pair:**
- Private Key: `NodeBPrivateKey` - configured in Node B's conf.yaml  
- Public Key: `NodeBPublicKey` - configured in Node A's peers.yaml

These keys ensure authentic libp2p cryptographic peer identification and connection establishment.

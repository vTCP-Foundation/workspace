## Executive Summary
This PRD introduces payment estimation capabilities that enable users to calculate either required payment amounts or expected receive amounts based on previously computed optimal exchange flow paths. Building upon the Exchange Flow Calculation (PRD 04), this feature provides bidirectional estimation without triggering new topology collection or flow calculation.

### Current project state
- Exchange Flow Calculation (PRD 04) computes optimal cross-equivalent payment paths using OR-Tools
- `InitiateMaxFlowExchangeCalculationTransaction` produces `mOptimalPathResults` with detailed path information
- Optimal paths are sorted by efficiency but not persisted for reuse

### This iteration's focus
- Create `ExchangePathsManager` to store and manage optimal path results per (contractor, sender_equivalent, receiver_equivalent)
- Implement bidirectional estimation: payment amount â†” receive amount
- Provide estimation based on cached optimal paths without recalculating topology
- Handle commissions, exchange limits, and capacity constraints during estimation

### Connection to overall vision
This enables efficient payment planning in the vTCP network by allowing users to estimate costs and outcomes before initiating actual payments, improving user experience and reducing unnecessary topology collection overhead.

## Iteration Context
### Previous Iterations Summary
- **PRD 01**: Database provider abstraction established multi-database support
- **PRD 03**: Exchange Rates Manager provides exchange rate storage with TTL management
- **PRD 04**: Exchange Flow Calculation implements cross-equivalent max flow computation using OR-Tools with optimal path enumeration and commission handling
- **Completed Features**: Topology collection, max flow calculation, optimal path computation with commissions

### Lessons Learned
- OR-Tools LP optimization provides detailed path information that can be reused
- Commission "charge once" semantics are critical for accurate flow simulation
- Path ordering by efficiency enables predictable estimation results
- Exchange rate limits must be validated during flow distribution

### Current State Analysis
- **What's working well**: Optimal path calculation produces comprehensive results
- **Pain points identified**: Path results are not persisted; each estimation would require full topology collection
- **Performance metrics**: OR-Tools optimization completes within acceptable timeframes for typical topologies

## Problem Statement
### Background
After computing maximum receivable flow using `InitiateMaxFlowExchangeCalculationTransaction`, users need to estimate:
1. How much they need to pay (in sender equivalent) to receive a specific amount (in receiver equivalent)
2. How much they will receive (in receiver equivalent) if they pay a specific amount (in sender equivalent)

Currently, this information exists in `mOptimalPathResults` within the transaction but is not accessible for subsequent queries, forcing users to either:
- Trigger new topology collection (expensive)
- Implement manual estimation (error-prone)

### Problem Description
**Who is affected**: All network participants planning cross-equivalent payments
**When and where**: During payment preparation and cost estimation phases
**Current limitations**:
- No access to computed optimal paths after max flow calculation completes
- No estimation API for payment/receive amount calculations
- Users cannot plan payment amounts effectively without triggering expensive operations

### Impact of not solving this problem
- Increased network overhead from redundant topology collections
- Poor user experience due to inability to estimate payment costs
- Potential for payment failures due to inaccurate manual estimations

### Success Metrics
**Primary KPIs**:
- Estimation accuracy matches actual flow simulation
- Zero additional topology collection overhead for estimation queries
- Estimation completes within 100ms for typical path sets

**Target Values**:
- 100% accuracy when optimal paths remain valid (within TTL)
- Support estimation for up to 100 cached optimal path results
- Handle edge cases (insufficient funds, no paths) with appropriate error codes

## Goals
The primary goals of this iteration are to provide efficient and accurate payment estimation capabilities.

*   **Goal 1: Enable bidirectional payment estimation.**
    *   **Description:** Allow users to estimate required payment amounts for desired receive amounts, and vice versa, using cached optimal paths.
    *   **Success Metric:** Estimation commands return accurate results matching flow simulation for 100% of valid cached paths within TTL.

*   **Goal 2: Minimize network overhead.**
    *   **Description:** Provide estimations using cached optimal paths without triggering topology collection or flow recalculation.
    *   **Success Metric:** Zero topology collection messages generated during estimation operations; all estimations served from cache.

*   **Goal 3: Handle edge cases gracefully.**
    *   **Description:** Detect and report situations where estimation cannot be performed (no cached data, insufficient capacity, amounts exceed limits).
    *   **Success Metric:** All error conditions return appropriate error codes (401, 412, 462) with clear semantics.

#### Enhancements to Existing Features

1. **InitiateMaxFlowExchangeCalculationTransaction Enhancement**
   - **Current State**: Computes optimal paths and stores in local `mOptimalPathResults`
   - **Proposed Changes**:
     - After OR-Tools optimization, split `mOptimalPathResults` by sender equivalent
     - For each sender equivalent, transfer paths starting with that equivalent to `ExchangePathsManager` with key (contractor, sender_equivalent, receiver_equivalent)
     - Associate paths with timestamp for TTL management
   - **Impact Assessment**: Minimal - adds path splitting and storage logic after optimization completes
   - **Migration Strategy**: No migration needed; purely additive change

2. **Data Structure Extraction**
   - **Current State**: `ExchangePath` and `OptimalPathResult` defined inline in transaction implementation
   - **Proposed Changes**:
     - Extract to `src/core/paths/lib/ExchangePath.h`
     - Extract to `src/core/paths/lib/OptimalPathResult.h`
     - Make structures reusable across transactions and manager
   - **Impact Assessment**: Refactoring only; no behavioral changes
   - **Migration Strategy**: Direct code extraction with header includes

### Non-Functional Requirements
#### Performance
- Estimation query completes within 100ms for typical path sets (â‰¤50 paths)
- Path storage memory overhead < 10MB for 100 cached contractor-equivalent pairs
- TTL cleanup runs efficiently without blocking estimation queries

#### Security
- Cached paths contain no sensitive cryptographic material

### Data Requirements
#### Data Models

##### ExchangePath (extracted to ExchangePath.h)
**Purpose**: Represents a single feasible payment path through the network

**Fields**:
- `vector<ContractorID> nodes`: Sequence of node IDs along the path
- `vector<SerializedEquivalent> equivalents`: Equivalent at each node (parallel to nodes)
- `vector<ExchangeStep> exchangeSteps`: Exchange operations performed along path
- `TrustLineAmount minCapacity`: Maximum flow this path can handle (accounting for commissions)
- `double effectiveExchangeRate`: Cumulative exchange rate (product of all exchanges)
- `TrustLineAmount totalCommissions`: Sum of fixed commissions along path (for reference)

**Methods**:
- `TrustLineAmount calculateMaxCapacity() const`: Returns minCapacity
- `double calculateEffectiveExchangeRate() const`: Returns effectiveExchangeRate
- `bool startsWithEquivalent(SerializedEquivalent eq) const`: Checks if path starts in given equivalent
- `bool isValid() const`: Validates path structure consistency

##### ExchangeStep (within ExchangePath.h)
**Purpose**: Describes a single exchange operation at a node

**Fields**:
- `ContractorID nodeID`: Node performing the exchange
- `SerializedEquivalent fromEquivalent`: Source equivalent
- `SerializedEquivalent toEquivalent`: Target equivalent
- `TrustLineAmount exchangeRate`: Exchange rate numerator
- `int16_t exchangeRateShift`: Decimal shift for rate precision
- `TrustLineAmount minExchangeAmount`: Minimum exchange amount
- `TrustLineAmount maxExchangeAmount`: Maximum exchange amount
- `TrustLineAmount commission`: Exchange commission (currently unused, always 0)

##### OptimalPathResult (extracted to OptimalPathResult.h)
**Purpose**: Stores result of OR-Tools optimization for a single path

**Fields**:
- `ExchangePath path`: The path structure
- `TrustLineAmount optimal_flow`: LP solver output (raw flow before commission simulation)
- `TrustLineAmount received_amount`: Amount delivered to receiver after all deductions
- `double effective_exchange_rate`: End-to-end exchange rate
- `double path_efficiency`: Ratio of received/sent (accounting for commissions)

**Notes**:
- `optimal_flow` may differ from actual usable flow due to commission deduplication during post-processing
- `received_amount` reflects actual delivered amount after "charge once" commission semantics

##### EdgeKey (helper structure for estimation algorithms)
**Purpose**: Unique identifier for a directed edge in the network topology

**Fields**:
```cpp
struct EdgeKey {
    ContractorID from;
    ContractorID to;
    SerializedEquivalent equivalent;

    bool operator<(const EdgeKey& other) const noexcept {
        if (from != other.from) return from < other.from;
        if (to != other.to) return to < other.to;
        return equivalent < other.equivalent;
    }
};
```

**Usage**:
- Used as map key to track remaining edge capacity during flow simulation
- Distinguishes between parallel edges in different equivalents (e.g., Aâ†’B in eq 1 vs Aâ†’B in eq 2)
- Distinguishes between bidirectional edges (Aâ†’B vs Bâ†’A in same equivalent)
- Enables accurate capacity tracking when multiple paths share the same physical edge

**Example**:
```cpp
// Track capacity consumption across paths
map<EdgeKey, double> edgeRemainingCapacity;

// Path 1 uses Aâ†’B in equivalent 1
EdgeKey key1{nodeA, nodeB, equivalent1};
edgeRemainingCapacity[key1] = initialCapacity - consumedByPath1;

// Path 2 uses Aâ†’B in equivalent 2 (different edge, same physical link)
EdgeKey key2{nodeA, nodeB, equivalent2};
edgeRemainingCapacity[key2] = initialCapacity - consumedByPath2;

// Reverse direction Bâ†’A in equivalent 1 (different edge)
EdgeKey key3{nodeB, nodeA, equivalent1};
edgeRemainingCapacity[key3] = reverseCapacity;
```

##### PathCacheKey (within ExchangePathsManager)
**Purpose**: Unique identifier for cached path set

**Fields**:
```cpp
struct PathCacheKey {
    ContractorID contractor;
    SerializedEquivalent senderEquivalent;
    SerializedEquivalent receiverEquivalent;

    bool operator<(const PathCacheKey& other) const {
        if (contractor != other.contractor) return contractor < other.contractor;
        if (senderEquivalent != other.senderEquivalent)
            return senderEquivalent < other.senderEquivalent;
        return receiverEquivalent < other.receiverEquivalent;
    }
};
```

**Notes**:
- Used as map key in `ExchangePathsManager`
- Supports same-equivalent scenarios (senderEquivalent == receiverEquivalent)
- Enables efficient lookup by specific equivalent pair

##### ExchangePathsManager
**Purpose**: Central cache for optimal path results from max flow calculations

**Storage**:
```cpp
struct CachedPathResult {
    vector<OptimalPathResult> paths;
    DateTime computedAt;
};

map<PathCacheKey, CachedPathResult> mCachedPaths;
```

**Constants**:
- `kPathResultsTTLSeconds = 600` (5 minutes)

**Key Methods**:
- `void storePaths(const PathCacheKey& key, const vector<OptimalPathResult>& paths)`: Store optimal paths for specific key
- `optional<vector<OptimalPathResult>> retrievePaths(const PathCacheKey& key)`: Retrieve cached paths if valid (within TTL)
- `void invalidatePaths(const PathCacheKey& key)`: Remove cached paths for specific key
- `void invalidatePathsForContractor(ContractorID contractor)`: Remove all cached paths for contractor
- `void invalidatePathsForEquivalent(SerializedEquivalent equivalent)`: Remove all cached paths involving equivalent (as sender or receiver)

**Private Methods (TTL Management)**:
- `void scheduleExpiryTimer()`: Schedule next expiry timer based on earliest expiry time
- `void onExpiryTimer(const boost::system::error_code& error)`: Timer callback to trigger cleanup
- `DateTime earliestExpiryTime() const`: Find earliest expiry time among cached paths
- `void removeExpiredPaths()`: Remove all paths exceeding TTL

**TTL Timer Implementation**:
- Uses `boost::asio::steady_timer` for automatic expiry scheduling
- Timer pattern follows `ExchangeRatesManager` (mExpiryTimer) and `TopologyTrustLinesManager` (mCommissionExpiryTimer)
- Timer reschedules itself after each cleanup based on next earliest expiry
- Requires `boost::asio::io_context` reference passed to constructor

**Data Members**:
```cpp
map<PathCacheKey, CachedPathResult> mCachedPaths;
mutex mCacheMutex;
Logger &mLog;
as::io_context &mIOContext;
unique_ptr<as::steady_timer> mExpiryTimer;
```

**Thread Safety**:
- Uses mutex for concurrent access protection
- Read operations lock only for duration of map access
- Timer callbacks execute on IO context thread, acquire mutex for cleanup

#### Data Storage
- All path caching is in-memory only
- No persistent storage for optimal paths
- TTL-based expiration ensures bounded memory usage

#### Data Migration
- No migration required; purely new functionality

### Estimation Algorithm Specifications

#### Payment Estimation Algorithm (Receive â†’ Payment)
**Goal**: Determine minimum payment amount in sender equivalent needed to deliver `targetReceiveAmount` in receiver equivalent.

**Input**:
- `contractorID`: Target contractor
- `targetReceiveAmount`: Desired receive amount
- `receiverEquivalent`: Equivalent in which to receive
- `senderEquivalent`: Equivalent in which to pay

**Algorithm**:
```cpp
TrustLineAmount estimatePaymentForReceive(
    ContractorID contractorID,
    TrustLineAmount targetReceiveAmount,
    SerializedEquivalent receiverEquivalent,
    SerializedEquivalent senderEquivalent)
{
    // Step 1: Retrieve cached paths for specific key
    PathCacheKey key{contractorID, senderEquivalent, receiverEquivalent};
    auto cachedPaths = mExchangePathsManager->retrievePaths(key);
    if (!cachedPaths) {
        throw NoPathsError(462); // No cached paths for this key
    }

    // Step 2: Paths are already sorted by efficiency (from max flow calculation)
    // Iterate through paths, simulating flow distribution

    TrustLineAmount remainingReceive = targetReceiveAmount;
    TrustLineAmount totalPayment = TrustLineAmount(0);

    set<pair<ContractorID, SerializedEquivalent>> appliedCommissions;
    map<EdgeKey, double> edgeRemainingCapacity; // Track consumed capacity

    for (const auto& pathResult : *cachedPaths) {
        if (remainingReceive == TrustLineAmount(0)) break;

        // Simulate: how much payment needed on this path to deliver remainingReceive?
        // This requires inverse simulation accounting for exchanges and commissions

        double targetForPath = std::min(
            remainingReceive.convert_to<double>(),
            pathResult.received_amount.convert_to<double>()
        );

        // Inverse transform through path (work backwards from receiver to sender)
        double requiredPayment = inverseSimulatePath(
            pathResult.path,
            targetForPath,
            appliedCommissions,
            edgeRemainingCapacity
        );

        if (requiredPayment <= 0.0) continue; // Path exhausted

        totalPayment = totalPayment + TrustLineAmount(static_cast<uint64_t>(requiredPayment));
        remainingReceive = remainingReceive - TrustLineAmount(static_cast<uint64_t>(targetForPath));
    }

    // Step 3: Check if target achieved
    if (remainingReceive > TrustLineAmount(0)) {
        throw InsufficientPathsError(412); // Cannot deliver requested amount
    }

    return totalPayment;
}
```

**Key Helper**: `inverseSimulatePath`
- Works backwards through path from receiver to sender
- Applies inverse exchange rates: `inputAmount = outputAmount / exchangeRate`
- Accounts for commissions: if commission was deducted on forward pass, add it back to compute required input
- Validates edge capacity: ensure required input doesn't exceed available capacity
- Returns required payment amount at sender to achieve target output at receiver

#### Receive Estimation Algorithm (Payment â†’ Receive)
**Goal**: Determine receive amount in receiver equivalent when paying `paymentAmount` in sender equivalent.

**Input**:
- `contractorID`: Target contractor
- `paymentAmount`: Amount to pay
- `senderEquivalent`: Equivalent in which to pay
- `receiverEquivalent`: Equivalent in which to receive

**Algorithm**:
```cpp
TrustLineAmount estimateReceiveForPayment(
    ContractorID contractorID,
    TrustLineAmount paymentAmount,
    SerializedEquivalent senderEquivalent,
    SerializedEquivalent receiverEquivalent)
{
    // Step 1: Retrieve cached paths for specific key
    PathCacheKey key{contractorID, senderEquivalent, receiverEquivalent};
    auto cachedPaths = mExchangePathsManager->retrievePaths(key);
    if (!cachedPaths) {
        throw NoPathsError(462); // No cached paths for this key
    }

    // Step 2: Paths are already sorted by efficiency
    // Distribute payment across paths, simulating flow

    TrustLineAmount remainingPayment = paymentAmount;
    TrustLineAmount totalReceive = TrustLineAmount(0);

    set<pair<ContractorID, SerializedEquivalent>> appliedCommissions;
    map<EdgeKey, double> edgeRemainingCapacity;

    for (const auto& pathResult : *cachedPaths) {
        if (remainingPayment == TrustLineAmount(0)) break;

        // Determine how much of remainingPayment can flow through this path
        double maxPathInput = pathResult.optimal_flow.convert_to<double>();
        double pathInput = std::min(
            remainingPayment.convert_to<double>(),
            maxPathInput
        );

        // Forward simulate to get output amount
        double pathOutput = forwardSimulatePath(
            pathResult.path,
            pathInput,
            appliedCommissions,
            edgeRemainingCapacity
        );

        if (pathOutput <= 0.0) continue; // Path produced no output

        totalReceive = totalReceive + TrustLineAmount(static_cast<uint64_t>(pathOutput));
        remainingPayment = remainingPayment - TrustLineAmount(static_cast<uint64_t>(pathInput));
    }

    // No error if remainingPayment > 0; just return what was delivered
    return totalReceive;
}
```

**Key Helper**: `forwardSimulatePath`
- Reuses logic from `InitiateMaxFlowExchangeCalculationTransaction::simulatePathNetAmount`
- Applies exchange rates: `outputAmount = inputAmount * exchangeRate`
- Deducts commissions with "charge once" semantics (checks `appliedCommissions` set)
- Validates edge capacity: reduces flow if edge insufficient
- Returns delivered amount at receiver

#### Commission Handling Details
**"Charge Once" Semantics**:
- Maintain `set<pair<ContractorID, SerializedEquivalent>> appliedCommissions` across all paths in estimation
- When simulating flow through a path segment:
  - Check if `(nodeID, equivalent)` is in `appliedCommissions`
  - If yes: skip commission deduction (already charged on previous path)
  - If no: deduct commission and add `(nodeID, equivalent)` to set

**Commission Refresh**:
- Estimations always fetch current commission values from `TopologyTrustLinesManager`
- If commissions changed since max flow calculation, new values apply
- This ensures estimation reflects current network state within cache TTL

#### Exchange Limit Validation
**Per-Step Validation**:
- When simulating flow through exchange step:
  - Extract `minExchangeAmount` and `maxExchangeAmount` from `ExchangeStep`
  - Check if flow amount falls within `[min, max]` range
  - If below min: skip path (cannot use exchange)
  - If above max: cap flow at max
  - If within range: proceed normally

**Multi-Step Exchanges**:
- Each exchange step validated independently
- Cumulative flow adjusted based on tightest constraint along path

### Error Handling Specifications

#### Error Code 401 (Unexpected Error)
**Trigger Conditions**:
- Exception thrown during estimation logic
- Invalid data structures encountered
- Memory allocation failures

**Response**:
```
401
```

**Logging**:
```cpp
error() << "Estimation failed with unexpected error: " << exception.what();
```

#### Error Code 412 (Insufficient Paths)
**Trigger Conditions**:
- Payment estimation: Cannot deliver requested `targetReceiveAmount` with available paths
- All paths exhausted but `remainingReceive > 0`

**Response**:
```
412
```

**Logging**:
```cpp
warning() << "Insufficient paths to deliver " << targetReceiveAmount
          << " to contractor " << contractorID
          << "; delivered only " << (targetReceiveAmount - remainingReceive);
```

#### Error Code 462 (No Cached Paths)
**Trigger Conditions**:
- No cached `OptimalPathResult` for specified (contractor, sender_equivalent, receiver_equivalent) key
- Cached paths expired (TTL exceeded)

**Response**:
```
462
```

**Logging**:
```cpp
warning() << "No cached optimal paths for contractor " << contractorID
          << " with sender equivalent " << senderEquivalent
          << " and receiver equivalent " << receiverEquivalent;
```

**User Action**:
- Trigger `InitiateMaxFlowExchangeCalculationTransaction` to compute paths
- Retry estimation after max flow calculation completes

## Risk Management
### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Inverse path simulation complexity | High | Medium | Thorough unit testing with known topologies; leverage existing forward simulation as reference |
| Commission "charge once" bugs | High | Medium | Extract commission logic into testable helper functions; extensive edge case testing |
| Thread safety issues in cache | Medium | Low | Use proven locking patterns; stress test with concurrent access |
| TTL cleanup performance | Low | Low | Implement efficient timer-based cleanup; monitor memory usage in tests |
| Path splitting logic errors | Medium | Low | Validate split paths against original mOptimalPathResults; unit test coverage |

### Business Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Estimation inaccuracy vs. actual payments | High | Low | Validate estimation algorithm against actual flow simulation; iterate based on discrepancies |

## Testing Strategy
### Testing Approach (Unit-Only)
- All testing is unit-only (no integration/E2E tests)
- Tests are built and executed exclusively in `build-tests`
- No Docker usage; mock all external dependencies
- Provide mock data for both SQLite and PostgreSQL where applicable

#### Unit Tests: New Components

**ExchangePathsManager Tests**:
- Store and retrieve paths with various PathCacheKey combinations
- TTL expiration: store paths, wait, verify auto-cleanup
- Invalidation by key: store multiple keys, invalidate one, verify others remain
- Invalidation by contractor: store paths for same contractor with different equivalents, invalidate contractor, verify all removed
- Invalidation by equivalent: store paths with mixed equivalents, invalidate one equivalent, verify correct subset removed
- Thread safety: concurrent store/retrieve operations
- Edge cases: retrieve non-existent key, store empty path list, same-equivalent scenarios (sender_eq == receiver_eq)

**Path Splitting Tests** (in InitiateMaxFlowExchangeCalculationTransaction):
- Mock `mOptimalPathResults` with paths starting from different sender equivalents
- Verify paths correctly split by sender equivalent
- Verify each split stored with correct PathCacheKey
- Test same-equivalent scenario (all paths use same sender_eq == receiver_eq)

**EstimatePaymentForReceiveAmountTransaction Tests**:

*Test Topology 1: Single-Equivalent Path (No Exchange)*
- Topology: A â†’ B â†’ C in equivalent 1 (sender_eq = receiver_eq = 1)
- Capacities: Aâ†’B = 1000, Bâ†’C = 800
- Commission: B has 10 unit commission in equivalent 1
- Test: Estimate payment for receive amount 500
  - Expected: ~510 (500 + 10 commission)
- Test: Estimate payment for receive amount 900
  - Expected: Error 412 (insufficient; max deliverable ~790)

*Test Topology 2: Cross-Equivalent Path with Exchange*
- Topology: A (eq 1) â†’ B (eq 1) â†’ X [1â†’2, rate=2.0] â†’ C (eq 2)
- Capacities: Aâ†’B = 1000, Bâ†’X = 800, Xâ†’C = 1500
- Key: (C, sender_eq=1, receiver_eq=2)
- Test: Estimate payment for receive amount 400 in eq 2
  - Expected: ~200 in eq 1 (400 / 2.0 exchange rate)
- Test: Estimate payment for receive amount 2000 in eq 2
  - Expected: Error 412 (max deliverable ~800 * 2.0 = 1600)

*Test Topology 3: Multi-Path with Commissions*
- Topology (same as PRD 04 commission example):
  - Path 1: A â†’ B â†’ F (2 hops)
  - Path 2: A â†’ B â†’ C â†’ F (3 hops)
  - Path 3: A â†’ B â†’ D â†’ E â†’ F (4 hops)
  - Commission on B: 10 units
- Capacities: Aâ†’B=1000, Bâ†’F=500, Bâ†’C=800, Câ†’F=200, Bâ†’D=700, Dâ†’E=300, Eâ†’F=900
- All in equivalent 2002 (sender_eq = receiver_eq = 2002)
- Key: (F, sender_eq=2002, receiver_eq=2002)
- Test: Estimate payment for receive amount 990
  - Expected: ~1000 (simulation should match optimal flow calculation)
  - Verify commission charged only once across all paths

*Test Topology 4: Exchange Min/Max Limits*
- Topology: A (eq 1) â†’ X [1â†’2, rate=1.5, min=100, max=500] â†’ B (eq 2)
- Key: (B, sender_eq=1, receiver_eq=2)
- Test: Estimate payment for receive amount 50 in eq 2
  - Expected: Error 412 (below exchange minimum: 50/1.5 â‰ˆ 33 < 100)
- Test: Estimate payment for receive amount 600 in eq 2
  - Expected: ~400 in eq 1 (max exchange output 500*1.5=750, so 600 deliverable)

*Error Case Tests*:
- No cached paths for key: Error 462
- Cached paths expired (mock TTL): Error 462
- Requested receive amount exceeds all path capacity: Error 412

**EstimateReceiveForPaymentAmountTransaction Tests**:

  - Expected: 0 (below exchange minimum)
- Test: Estimate receive for payment amount 600 in eq 1
  - Expected: ~750 in eq 2 (capped at max exchange: 500 * 1.5)

*Error Case Tests*:
- No cached paths for key: Error 462
- Cached paths expired (mock TTL): Error 462

**Flow Simulation Algorithm Tests**:
- `forwardSimulatePath`: Verify exchange rate application, commission deduction, capacity limits
- `inverseSimulatePath`: Verify inverse exchange rates, commission addition, capacity validation

- Verify max flow calculation still produces identical results
- Verify optimal path ordering remains consistent

#### Execution in CI/Locally
- Build tests in `build-tests` and run the produced binaries
- All unit tests must pass before PRD completion

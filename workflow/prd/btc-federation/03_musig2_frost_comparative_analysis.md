## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the requirements for conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of MuSig2 and FROST multisignature schemes for Bitcoin Taproot implementations. The analysis will evaluate performance characteristics, security properties, implementation complexity, and scalability considerations for federation sizes ranging from 64 to 512+ participants. The deliverable will be a detailed technical report that provides decision-makers with clear guidance on multisignature scheme selection.

## Overview

The BTC Federation requires a thorough technical analysis to select the most appropriate multisignature scheme for its Taproot implementation. This PRD establishes the scope, methodology, and deliverables for comparing MuSig2 and FROST schemes across critical evaluation criteria. The analysis will be based on external research, academic literature, and industry implementations rather than internal test results.

## Business Justification

### Strategic Need
The BTC Federation must select an optimal multisignature scheme before beginning implementation. Without a comprehensive comparative analysis, the project risks:
- Choosing suboptimal technology that limits future scalability
- Underestimating implementation complexity and development costs
- Missing critical security considerations that could compromise the federation
- Making uninformed trade-offs between performance, security, and complexity

### Decision Impact
The multisignature scheme selection will determine:
- Technical architecture and implementation approach
- Development timeline and resource allocation
- Performance characteristics and user experience
- Security model and threat resistance
- Long-term scalability and maintenance requirements

### Business Value
A thorough comparative analysis will:
- Enable informed technical decision-making
- Reduce implementation risks and development costs
- Provide clear justification for technology choices
- Establish performance and security benchmarks
- Create documentation for future reference and updates

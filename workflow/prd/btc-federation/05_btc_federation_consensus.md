   - [ADR-005 HotStuff Consensus Protocol](/architecture/btc-federation/adrs/ADR-005-hotstuff-consensus-protocol.md)

## Executive Summary
**Objective**: Implement a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol for the BTC Federation using HotStuff protocol [(ADR-005)](/architecture/btc-federation/adrs/ADR-005-hotstuff-consensus-protocol.md).

**Key Deliverables**:
- Implementation of HotStuff consensus protocol
- Integration with P2P network stack
- Integration with logging system
- Documentation and operational procedures


todo: include info that the implementation must implement "basic" hotstuff consensus protocol, not the "pipeline" version.
   Pipelined version can be implemented further in the future.

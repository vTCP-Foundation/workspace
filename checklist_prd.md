# PRD Flow Checklist

This checklist outlines the standard procedure for creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD). Following these steps ensures that PRDs are comprehensive, well-contextualized, and aligned with project policies before development work begins.

## Phase 1: Initial Draft and Context Gathering

### 1. Create the PRD File
- **Action:** Clone the `template_prd.md` file.
- **Location:** Place the new PRD file in the appropriate directory as specified by the `policy.md` file (e.g., `workflow/prd/<project-name>/`).

### 2. Perform a "Brain Dump"
- **Action:** Fill out the PRD with all available information, context, and details regarding the problem to be solved.
- **Important:** This initial step should be performed **without AI assistance**. The goal is to transfer all known details, nuances, and the "sense of importance" from your own understanding directly into the document. This prevents the loss of critical context that can occur when relying on AI too early in the creative process.

### 3. Link Supporting Materials
- **Action:** Embed or link to all relevant documents and resources that can provide additional context for the task.
- **Examples:**
    - Links to specific code files or directories.
    - References to Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
    - Links to previous or related PRDs.
    - Any other supporting documentation.

## Phase 2: Validation and Refinement

### 4. Validate the PRD with AI
- **Action:** Use the `prompts/prd_validation_prompt.md` to validate the PRD against all project requirements.
- **Requirement:** To ensure a robust and unbiased review, the validation must be performed using at least **two different advanced AI models** (e.g., Gemini, Claude, etc.). This cross-validation helps identify a wider range of potential issues and ensures the PRD is clear and comprehensive.
